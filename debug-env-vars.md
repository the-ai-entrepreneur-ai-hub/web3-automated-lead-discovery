# Debug Environment Variables Issue

## The Real Problem

The OAuth authentication is working perfectly, but the server is using the wrong `CLIENT_URL` value.

## Log Analysis
From your logs, we see:
```
ðŸ”„ Redirecting to: https://rawfreedomai.com/auth-success?token=...
```

This means `process.env.CLIENT_URL` is set to `https://rawfreedomai.com` on your production server.

## Root Cause
Your production server (Railway) has a `CLIENT_URL` environment variable set to the wrong value.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Update Railway Environment Variables
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Find your project 
3. Go to Variables/Environment tab
4. Update `CLIENT_URL` to your actual frontend URL:
   - `https://web3-prospector.netlify.app` OR
   - `https://dulcet-madeleine-2018aa.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Check What URL Your Frontend Actually Uses
Based on your CORS settings, it could be:
- `https://web3-prospector.netlify.app`
- `https://dulcet-madeleine-2018aa.netlify.app`
- `https://web3-automated-lead-discovery.netlify.app`

### Option 3: Debug What CLIENT_URL is Set To
Add this debug endpoint to see what environment variables are set:

```javascript
app.get('/debug/env', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    CLIENT_URL: process.env.CLIENT_URL,
    NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    allEnvVars: Object.keys(process.env).filter(key => key.includes('CLIENT'))
  });
});
```

## The Fix
Update Railway's `CLIENT_URL` environment variable to match your actual frontend deployment URL.
