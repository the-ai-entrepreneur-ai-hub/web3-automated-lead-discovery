**Thread 1/10** 🧵

We got some brutally honest feedback about Web3Radar. Here's how we're rebuilding everything from scratch.

Last week, we gave early access to a few Web3 BD pros. We thought we'd built a time-saving machine. Their feedback was humbling, direct, and incredibly valuable.

The problem we thought we were solving:
"Manual prospecting in Web3 is broken. Teams spend hours on CoinGecko, Twitter, and Telegram trying to find the next big project."

So we built Web3Radar to automate this discovery 24/7.

But we were wrong about what the real problem was...

**3/10**

💥 THE REALITY CHECK:

We quickly learned that *finding* projects wasn't the real problem.

One user, a BD lead at a top launchpad, told us bluntly:
"The scrape itself is not a big deal... the big problem is to have the contact (TG would be gold) of the person in charge."

Ouch. 🎯

**4/10**

Another user was even more direct:
"I wish there was a way to filter projects based on what they are... cause I mostly noticed that the projects shown were memecoins"

Our 10,000+ project database was useless if you couldn't find the 10 projects that mattered to you. 🤦‍♂️

---

**5/10**

To top it off, our website was broken.

A potential customer pointed out:
- Our demo didn't work 
- Contact page led to a 404
- Trial flow was confusing

Trust is everything in B2B. We were failing at the basics. 😬

---

**6/10**

But here's the thing - this feedback was a GIFT 🎁

It gave us a crystal clear mandate. We're shifting our entire focus.

Here's our new public roadmap:

---

**7/10**

🔧 PHASE 1: FIXING THE FOUNDATION (48 hours)
✅ Fixed broken site (links work, demo is live)
✅ Clear trial messaging: "14-Day Free Trial (No Credit Card)"
✅ Honest marketing copy - no more overpromising

Trust is everything.

---

**8/10**

🔑 PHASE 2: CONTACTS ARE KING (Next 4 weeks)
Our #1 priority is now Contact Enrichment.

We're building functionality to find:
- Telegram handles of founders
- Verified emails of decision-makers
- Not just generic info@ addresses

This is what justifies $99/mo.

---

**9/10**

🎯 PHASE 3: FILTERS ARE FREEDOM (Next 2 weeks)
You'll soon filter by:
- Category (DeFi, Gaming, RWA, Infrastructure)
- Project Stage (Pre-Token, Live Token, Testnet)
- Funding Stage

Find exactly what you need, nothing else.

---

**10/10**

We're building this FOR you, so we want to build it WITH you.

To the early users who gave us this feedback - thank you 🙏

### We Got Some Brutally Honest Feedback. Here's How We're Rebuilding Web3Radar.

**The vulnerability that led to clarity**

Last week, we gave a few Web3 BD professionals early access to our new tool, Web3Radar. We thought we had built a time-saving machine that would revolutionize how teams discover and connect with Web3 projects.

Their feedback was humbling, direct, and incredibly valuable. Here's what they told us, and what we're doing about it.

#### The Problem We Thought We Were Solving

Manual prospecting in Web3 is genuinely broken. Teams spend countless hours scrolling through CoinGecko, Twitter threads, and Telegram channels trying to find the next promising project. We built Web3Radar to automate this discovery process 24/7, delivering a curated feed of new Web3 projects with key information.

On paper, it made perfect sense. In reality, we had completely misunderstood the actual pain point.

#### The Reality Check: What Users Actually Need

**Discovery isn't the problem. Connection is.**

One user, a BD lead at a top-tier launchpad, delivered the truth with surgical precision:

*"I've built in-house the same scraping mechanism... the scrape itself is not a big deal... the big problem is to have the contact (TG would be gold) of the person in charge."*

Another user highlighted our data usability crisis:

*"I wish there was a way to filter projects based on what they are... cause I mostly noticed that the projects shown were memecoins. I'm currently looking for early stage projects without a token atm!"*

Our 10,000+ project database was essentially worthless if users couldn't find the 10 projects that actually mattered to them.

#### The Trust Problem

To compound our product issues, our website was broken. A potential customer pointed out several critical problems:
- "When trying to 'Watch Demo' — there is no demo to watch?"
- "The contact page is 'Not found'"
- Confusing trial messaging that mixed free trials with payment requirements

In B2B software, trust is your foundation. We were failing at the absolute basics.

#### Our Response: A Complete Strategic Pivot

This feedback wasn't criticism – it was a roadmap. Here's how we're completely rebuilding Web3Radar:

**Phase 1: Rebuilding Trust (48 Hours)**
- ✅ Fixed all broken links and created working demo
- ✅ Clarified trial process: "Start 14-Day Free Trial (No Credit Card Required)"
- ✅ Rewrote marketing copy to be honest about current capabilities vs. future roadmap

**Phase 2: Contact Enrichment as Priority Zero (Next 4 Weeks)**
We're shifting our entire development focus to contact enrichment:
- Finding Telegram handles of key personnel (founders, BD leads, CTOs)
- Sourcing verified email addresses (not generic info@ addresses)
- Integrating with professional enrichment APIs
- Building custom logic to identify decision-makers

This is the feature that transforms us from a "nice-to-have" discovery tool into a "must-have" lead generation platform that justifies our $99/month price point.

**Phase 3: Intelligent Filtering (Next 2 Weeks)**
Based directly on user feedback, we're implementing:
- Category filters (DeFi, Gaming, RWA, Infrastructure, Meme coins)
- Project stage filters (Pre-Token, Live Token, Testnet)
- Funding stage and amount filters

Users will find exactly what they need and ignore everything else.

#### Building With Our Community

The most valuable lesson from this experience: our users aren't just customers, they're collaborators in building the solution they actually need.

We're committing to radical transparency in our development process. Every feature we build will be informed by direct user feedback. Every sprint will be shared publicly.

To the early users who took the time to give us honest feedback – thank you. Your directness saved us months of building the wrong thing.

For Web3 professionals reading this: we're building this tool for you. Try our free trial, tell us what's missing, and we'll build it.

**Key Takeaways for Fellow Builders:**
1. **User feedback is more valuable than user acquisition** in the early stages
2. **Honest marketing builds more trust than perfected positioning**
3. **Product-market fit requires constant iteration**, not just initial development
4. **Building in public creates accountability** and community investment

### Subject: We Were Building the Wrong Thing (And How User Feedback Saved Us)

**The story of how brutal honesty redirected our entire product strategy**

Three weeks ago, Web3Radar was a project discovery tool. Today, it's becoming a contact enrichment platform. Here's the story of how user feedback completely transformed our roadmap – and why we're sharing every detail publicly.

#### The Confidence Before the Storm

We launched Web3Radar with a clear thesis: Web3 BD teams waste too much time manually discovering new projects. Our solution seemed obvious – automate the discovery process with a 24/7 feed of curated Web3 projects.

The product worked exactly as designed. We scraped thousands of projects, analyzed their data, and presented everything in a clean dashboard. Our early metrics looked promising. Users were signing up. The product was functional.

We were confident we'd solved the problem.

#### The Feedback That Changed Everything

We reached out to several Web3 BD professionals for feedback sessions. What we heard completely shattered our assumptions.

**Piero, BD lead at a major launchpad:**
*"I've built in-house the same scraping mechanism... the scrape itself is not a big deal... the big problem is to have the contact (TG would be gold) of the person in charge."*

**Francis, BD professional:**
*"I wish there was a way to filter projects based on what they are... cause I mostly noticed that the projects shown were memecoins. I'm currently looking for early stage projects without a token atm!"*

**Anonymous feedback through a colleague:**
*"When trying to 'Watch Demo' — there is no demo to watch? The contact page is 'Not found'."*

Each piece of feedback revealed a fundamental flaw in our approach:

1. **Discovery wasn't the bottleneck** – experienced BD professionals already had discovery solved
2. **Contact enrichment was the real need** – finding the right person to talk to was the valuable problem
3. **Data without filtering was noise** – 10,000 projects meant nothing if you couldn't find relevant ones
4. **Trust issues were blocking adoption** – broken website elements immediately destroyed credibility

#### The Strategic Pivot

Rather than defend our original vision, we embraced the feedback completely. Here's how we're rebuilding Web3Radar:

**Immediate Trust Recovery (48-hour sprint):**
- Fixed all broken links and demo functionality
- Clarified trial messaging to remove friction
- Rewrote marketing copy to accurately reflect current capabilities

**Contact Enrichment as Core Value (4-week development cycle):**
- Prioritizing Telegram handle discovery for key personnel
- Building verified email enrichment (beyond generic addresses)
- Developing decision-maker identification algorithms
- Integrating with professional data APIs

**Intelligent Filtering System (2-week parallel development):**
- Category-based filtering (DeFi, Gaming, RWA, Infrastructure)
- Project stage filtering (Pre-Token, Live Token, Testnet)
- Funding stage and amount parameters

#### Lessons for Fellow Builders

**1. User feedback beats user acquisition in early stages**
We could have spent months optimizing our discovery algorithm. Instead, three honest conversations revealed we were optimizing the wrong thing entirely.

**2. Defensive thinking kills products**
Our initial instinct was to explain why users were wrong about needing contact enrichment. Fortunately, we caught ourselves and listened instead.

**3. Building in public creates accountability**
Sharing this story publicly commits us to following through on these changes. Our community becomes invested in our success.

**4. Trust is your foundation**
No amount of great features matter if your website doesn't work. Basic professionalism isn't optional in B2B.

#### What's Next

We're committing to radical transparency in our rebuild process. Every sprint will be shared publicly. Every major decision will be explained. Our users aren't just customers – they're collaborators in building the solution they actually need.

If you're building in the Web3 space, we'd love your input on what contact enrichment features would be most valuable to your workflow.

The best products aren't built in isolation. They're built in conversation with the people who need them most.
